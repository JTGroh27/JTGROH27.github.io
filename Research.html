        <h2 class="text-center">The Office is a Cult Classic, But How Many People Have Truly Seen it? </h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Debuting on March 24, 2005, <em>The Office</em> didn’t get off to the best start in North America. <em>The Office</em> was a North American version of a show also titled<em> The Office</em> that was originally from the U.K.  The North American version of <em>The Office</em> had a rough first season, which is solidified by show writer Michael Schur’s comment, “We made six episodes that first season, and no one liked it.” Eventually the show ran for 9 total seasons ending on May 16, 2013.</p>

			  <p>As a college student, <em>The Office</em> is one of the most talked about shows among people that I know. I started to wonder though, how many people have really watched <em>The Office</em> and have been able to finish all 9 seasons? I finished the show while in high school when I was 17 years old, so I wanted to figure out what age group has truly seen <em>The Office</em> in its entirety. I decided to make a poll and post it on Snapchat and Instagram, because I have the most follower interaction on those apps. The results I got were surprising.</p>
			   <h2 class="text-center">Research Results </h2>
		    <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>I kept the poll simple by asking 3 questions:
1.	How old are you?
2.	Have you seen <em>The Office</em> in its entirety?
3.	Have you watched the entirety of any of these following shows?
More to come on question 3 later, but for now I want to focus on the first 2 questions. </p>
			<p>The age groups I provided for question 1 are between 16-21, 22-30, 31-50, and 51 or older. Most of the responses are between 16-21 (59.1%), while 40.9% were between 22-30. Nobody who answered is older than 30. Of those who answered, 63.6% have seen <em>The Office</em> in its entirety. I was shocked to not see that number be higher. Then I started to wonder, who watched this show during season 2? Who were the people that kept <em>The Office</em> alive after its mixed reviews from season 1?</p>
			<p>I turned to JPF&amp;T (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/vjpf20" target="_blank">Journal of Popular Film and Television</a>) to answer my question. As it turns out, “<em>The Office</em> ranked fifth among twenty-five- to fifty-four-year-old viewers,” through the first 6 weeks of season 2. Twenty-five all the way to fifty-four is quite the large age jump, so I was surprised to see nobody answer my poll above the age of 30. However, that was in 2006, before Netflix allowed for anyone to tune into The Office at any time they wanted. Compared to JPF&amp;T’s results, my research suggests that the largest audience for <em>The Office </em>would be between the ages of 16-21.</p>

		<h2 class="text-center">Comparing Other Shows </h2>
			 <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>One other topic that is routinely brought up when talking about <em>The Office </em>is its competitors or similar shows. There was a period often referred to as one of the best eras of TV comedy history, in which <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>The Offic</em><em>e</em>, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, and <em>Community</em> were all being aired on the same night. I decided to figure out which other of those shows, plus a few more, have been seen by the people who answered my poll. I listed other shows that are fundamentally similar to<em> The Office</em>, which typically involve the show being a sitcom without a laugh track. Often referred to as a “mocumentary,” I felt that these shows have the most popularity among the 16–21-year-old audience. I found out that most people who answered my poll have also seen<em> Parks and Rec </em>in its entirety.</p>
			<img src="./Images/MC327 Research Poll Results.png" alt="NBC Lineup" width="55%" class="mr-3 img-fluid">
			  <p>After <em>Parks and Rec’s</em> 50%, 36.4% of people have not seen any of the shows provided in their entirety. The most surprising result it <em>30 Rock</em> at 0%. Absolutely nobody that answered my poll has seen <em>30 Rock</em> in its entirety. While I haven’t even seen an episode of <em>30 Rock</em> myself, I have only heard amazing things about it, especially from people who enjoy <em>The Office</em>.</p>
		<h2 class="text-center">Conclusion </h2>
			 	 <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Why did I do all this research on <em>The Office</em>? I simply love the show, along with most of the other shows provided. A lot of who I am is defined by <em>The Office, Parks and Rec, Community</em>, and recently <em>Modern Family</em>. Whether you’ve seen any of these shows once or all the way through six times, I’d stress that you give them all a try. Whether you are just now subscribing to a streaming service with one of these shows, or you’re 85 years old and want a new show to watch, any of these shows are amazing options.</p>
