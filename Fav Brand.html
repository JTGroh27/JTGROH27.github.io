        <h2 class="text-center">Favorite Brand </h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>While thinking of brands to choose from, I decided on my all-time favorite brand, <a href="https://products.drpepper.com/en?gclid=CjwKCAiA-dCcBhBQEiwAeWidtTydyxmEKrAPMs0uFTgoaHTiJxL61nlML5uJnrCrnlYxsif3FY4u9RoC_gMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Dr. Pepper</a>. Obviously, Dr. Pepper is a well-known beverage company which produces a line of sodas that include the original Dr. Pepper drink, famous for its’ twenty-three distinct flavors, Dr. Pepper Dark Berry, which is a limited time release that they promote with the release of a blockbuster movie in the summer, and Dr. Pepper Cream Soda. Along with many more flavors, Dr. Pepper also has a merchandise line that has a range of products spanning from hoodies to backpacks, and even dog collars. Dr. Pepper also has a rewards program and even a scholarship, which gives up to $650,000 to qualified students. The Dr. Pepper website easily and clearly communicates its’ products and everything else the brand has to offer. Their website also has easily accessible links to their social media accounts, which Dr. Pepper is very active on. On social media, Dr. Pepper will promote their new products while responding to fans/customers about details, and specifically on Twitter, will make jokes tying in Dr. Pepper.</p>
			  
		<h2 class="text-center">Why Dr. Pepper?</h2>
			   <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>I chose Dr. Pepper because their website is a smart and easy layout, and their font is very recognizable and easy to read, while still having a flare to it. The banner uses their signature maroon, but when you hover over an item in the navbar, the color shifts to a lighter red that complements the maroon. There is also a small header above the banner that is in a darker maroon that creates a flow of reds. The logo color and font color are white, which is plain and easy to see on the maroon background. The signature Dr. Pepper font accompanied by a basic font like arial makes things easy to comprehend.</p>

		<h2 class="text-center">What do I Plan to Use?</h2>
			  	   <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>I plan on using a font fairly similar to the Dr. Pepper font called Calistoga. Calistoga is a very fun font that pops and will look good in my headers. To accompany Calistoga, I will be using the Acme font. Acme is a little more basic and easier to read, and it naturally looks a little bolder. This will make for a good body font. I will also use a maroon similar to the Dr. Pepper maroon for my banner, accompanied by a gold-yellow. </p>
		<h2 class="text-center">Logo Header</h2>
			  	  	   <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>My logo header is going to be simple and easy to read, while still giving the page viewer a glimpse into who I am. I thought it would be ironic to make my header look like a webpage itself, so I went with one that has the gold color for the body and has my name and school year in the main text box. I chose the webpage look because I am online a lot and constantly surfing the web. I tend to be the first to "google" something when someone has a question. </p>
