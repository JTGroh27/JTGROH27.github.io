		<h2 class="text-center">Introduction</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Last fall was my first time moving out of my house from back home which was a big deal for me. I moved into <a href="https://www.siue.edu/housing/housing-options/cougar-village/index.shtml" target="_blank">Cougar Village at SIUE</a> and my roommate was a friend of mine whom I worked with for the past 3 years at that point at Culver’s. We were best friends, so when he hit me with the news that he couldn’t return for the spring semester, I was devastated. I was without a roommate, living on my own for the first time. Eventually depression and anxiety started to overcome me. I needed some sort of help; I wasn’t sure how to live alone. That’s when I decided to get a cat.</p>

		<h2 class="text-center">Adopting</h2>
		<div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>My mom and I started to look for places to adopt from and we found a shelter called <a href="https://odas.org/" target="_blank">Open Door Animal Sanctuary</a>. I looked through a whole basement of grown cats from ages 1-10. Eventually they led us to a room of kittens, some adopted, some not old enough, and very few remained available to adopt. Once I saw this little guy named, “Peasy” at the time, I knew it had to be him. A representative of the sanctuary came out to my apartment and okayed the space, and from there I was able to pick up Peasy. Once again, my mom and I made the drive out to the Open Door Animal Sanctuary, this time to bring home who I now call Meelo.</p>
		<h2 class="text-center">Settling In</h2>
			 <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Meelo settled into the apartment right away, and when I got back from my classes the next day, I saw him sleeping on my couch waiting for my return. About a week later I decided to take Meelo out on a walk. Meelo was quite the stubborn little kitten when we were out at the <a href="https://www.siue.edu/gardens/" target="_blank">Gardens at SIUE</a>. Instead of walking around, he liked to stand in one area and investigate the ground around him. Sometimes Meelo would just lay down in the grass or on the rocks. Eventually, a woman brought her 3 dogs to swim in the pond. Meelo behaved so well that he just sat and watched as the dogs jumped into the water, rushed back onto land, only to jump right back into the water. As time passed at Cougar Village, I couldn’t help but think what a great idea getting a cat was. I used to have trouble sleeping at night when living alone but adding Meelo to the mix eased my anxiety and I started getting better sleep. A cat’s purrs can do wonders, it’s amazing how soothing purring is. Eventually Meelo got his own bed to sleep in next to mine, and he absolutely loved his bed.</p>

			  <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p>Once the fall 2022 semester started, I moved into <a href="https://www.thesocialedwardsville.com/" target="_blank">The Social</a> in Edwardsville, and of course Meelo came with me. We’re both settling in nicely and are getting accustomed to my new roommate, David, and his cat Ari. Meelo now has a friend for when I’m not at home and I have 2 cats to enjoy. Meelo likes to explore the new apartment and tries to get onto the highest places possible, which have included climbing on top of my closet somehow. Meelo turned 1-year-old on October 15th.</p>
